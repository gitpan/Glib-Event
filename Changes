Revision history for Glib::Event

0.2  Tue Nov 29 16:57:13 CET 2005
	- don't use a timeout watcher as one_event already provides
          one, and ours is called even after it has been canceled, leading to
          segfaults or worse.
        - improved documentation.

0.1  Sun Nov 27 13:45:36 CET 2005
	- original version, a Linux::Inotify2 clone.
