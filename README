NAME
    Glib::Event - Coerce Glib into using the Event module as event loop.

SYNOPSIS
     use Glib::Event;

     # example with Gtk2:
     use Gtk2;
     use Glib::Event;
     use Event; # any order
     Event->timer (after => 1, interval => 1, cb => sub { print "I am here!\n" });
     main Gtk2;
     # etc., it just works

DESCRIPTION
    This module coerces the Glib event loop to use the Event module as
    underlying event loop, i.e. Event will be used by Glib for all events.

    This makes Glib compatible to Event. Calls into the Glib main loop are
    more or less equivalent to calls to "Event::loop".

    * The Glib perl module is not used.
        This module has no dependency on the existing Glib perl interface,
        as it uses glib directly. The Glib module can, however, be used
        without any problems.

    * The default context will be changed when the module is loaded.
        Loading this module will automatically "patch" the default context
        of libglib, so normally nothing more is required.

BUGS
      * No documented API to patch other main contexts.
      * Uses one_event, which is inefficient.

SEE ALSO
    Event, Glib, Glib::MainLoop.
